# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Maxim, and I'm interested in programming.

## Interests

# Python <img src="https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/community/logos/python-logo-only.png" alt="Python Logo" width="35"/>
I heavily use Python for projects I want done quickly. I am currently working on 2 discord bots for a Roblox game marketplace where you can sell your source code, and I am working on a **Discord** bot that bans people from both **Discord** and Roblox.
# Rust <img src="https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-blk.svg" alt="Rust Logo" width="50" />
I like to use Rust for more efficient applications. In this language, I do everything that comes to mind just to make the code run 1 ms faster. My last project was a fast stock screener.
# Roblox (luau) <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/5/58/Roblox_2022.svg/revision/latest?cb=20250706153200" alt="Roblox logo" width="200" />
I code in Roblox luau to create games. Currently I am working on a Roblox game called Neverhome, a Roblox backrooms inspired horror story game. https://discord.gg/mjAkrqCGp6
