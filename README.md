# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Maxim, and I'm interested in programming.

## Interests

### Python
I heavily use Python for projects I want done quickly. I am currently working on 2 discord bots for a Roblox game marketplace where you can sell your source code, and I am working on a **Discord** bot that bans people from both **Discord** and Roblox.
### Rust
I like to use Rust for more efficient applications. In this language, I do everything that comes to mind just to make the code run 1 ms faster. My last project was a fast stock screener.
### Roblox (luau)
I code in Roblox luau to create games. Currently I am working on a Roblox game called Neverhome, a Roblox backrooms inspired horror story game. https://discord.gg/mjAkrqCGp6
